# ruby-mws [DEPRECATED]

by Erik Lyngved

ruby-mws is a Ruby gem that wraps the Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS) API.

I made this gem a few years ago for my own purposes with the intention of open sourcing it. It's not fully featured as I only implemented what I needed at the time. I've moved on to other projects and **I am no longer maintaining this gem.**

Feel free to use this gem in any capacity and check out the Pull Requests others have submitted to introduce functionality for other endpoints. If you are still evaluating different MWS gems, you may want to check out [Peddler](https://github.com/hakanensari/peddler) which is currently being maintained and is more fully featured.

Quick Start
-----------

To quickly test your connection to the service without credentials, you can ping the server, which returns server time in UTC:

    MWS::Base.server_time

### Initialization

Pass in your developer account credentials. All four params below are required.

    mws = MWS.new (:aws_access_key_id => "AKIAIFKEXAMPLE4WZHHA",
      :secret_access_key => "abc123def456/SECRET/+ghi789jkl",
      :seller_id => "A27WEXAMPLEBXY",
      :marketplace_id => "ATVPDKIKX0DER")

### Requests

We'll use the Orders API to retrieve recently updated orders.

    # Retrieve all orders updated within the last 4 hours
    response = mws.orders.list_orders :last_updated_after => 4.hours.ago   # ActiveSupport time helper

(All datetime fields accept Time or DateTime objects, as well as strings in iso8601 format.)

### Responses

Response objects inherit [Hashie](http://github.com/intridea/hashie) for easy access and [Rash](http://github.com/tcocca/rash) to convert Amazon's CamelCase convention to underscore. So you're just left with plain ol' Ruby goodness.

Let's parse our response to view the orders and any other data returned.

    response.orders.first   # => { "amazon_order_id" => "002-EXAMPLE-0031387",
                            #      "purchase_date" => "2012-01-13T19:11:46.000Z",
                            #      ... }

Response objects are accessible in Hash or method notation.

    response.orders == response[:orders]   # => true

Use `keys` and `has_key?` to discover what's in the response.

    response.keys   # => ["last_updated_before", "orders"]
    response.has_key? :last_updated_before   # => true

### NextToken requests

For responses with long lists of data, results are returned from the service in pages (usually 100 per page). Example:

    response = mws.orders.list_orders :last_updated_after => 1.week.ago   # returns 100 orders & next_token

Here, there are more orders to be returned. You can call `has_next?` on the same API instance to see if the last response returned has a next page. If so, calling `next` will make the request for the next page.

    mws.orders.has_next?   # => true
    next_response = mws.orders.next   # returns next page of orders

Repeat as necessary. You can keep calling `next` on the API instance as long as `has_next?` returns true.

Or if you need to, you can save `next_token` and go about the manual way as per Amazon's docs:

    next_response = mws.orders.list_orders_by_next_token :next_token => response.next_token

API
---

    @mws = MWS.new(authentication_hash)   # initialize the connection object (see above)

This object can be used to access all API services. Below are examples on how to make the different requests that are available so far. Refer to the [Amazon MWS Reference Docs](https://developer.amazonservices.com/) for available fields for each request.

### Products API

* ListMatchingProducts - Gets a list of products and their attributes, based on a search query
    `@mws.products.list_matching_products query: 'Habermaas'`

    `:query` receive any string
    `:query_context_id` receive any of the values listed [here](http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/products/Products_QueryContextIDs.html)


* GetMatchingProduct - Gets a list of products and their attributes, based on a list of ASIN values.
    `@mws.products.get_matching_product asin_list: "asincode"`

    `:asin_list` can be an array to retrieve multiple products


* GetMatchingProductForId - Gets a list of products and their attributes, based on a list of ASIN, GCID, SellerSKU, UPC, EAN, ISBN, and JAN values

    `@mws.products.get_matching_product_for_id id_list: "B0012KCLIG", id_type: "ASIN"`

    `:id_list` can be an array to retrieve multiple products
    `:id_type` can be any of the following ASIN, GCID, SellerSKU, UPC, EAN, ISBN, and JAN

### Orders API

* ListOrders - Gets orders by time range and other parameters

    `@mws.orders.list_orders :last_updated_after => Time.now-4.hours, :order_status => 'Shipped'`

* GetOrder - Gets orders by Amazon order ID

    `@mws.orders.get_order :amazon_order_id => "002-EXAMPLE-0031387"`

    `:amazon_order_id` can be an array to retrieve multiple orders.

* ListOrderItems - Gets order items for one order ID (only one order at a time here)

    `@mws.orders.list_order_items :amazon_order_id => "002-EXAMPLE-0031387"`

### Fulfillment Inventory API

* ListInventorySupply - Returns availability of inventory, only returns items based on list of SKUs or last change date

    `@mws.inventory.list_inventory_supply :seller_skus => ['PF-5VZN-04XR', 'V4-03EY-LAL1', 'OC-TUKC-031P']`
    `@mws.inventory.list_inventory_supply :query_start_date_time => Time.now-1.day`

### Reports API

* RequestReport - Used to submit a request for a report by [report type](http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/reports/Reports_ReportType.html). Returns report request info.

    `@mws.reports.request_report :report_type => "_GET_FBA_FULFILLMENT_CUSTOMER_RETURNS_DATA_", :start_date => 1.day.ago, :end_date => Time.now`

* GetReportRequestList - Returns a list of the most recently requested reports. Use `report_request_id` to find the status of your report. Once `report_processing_status` for your request is "_DONE_", use `generated_report_id` to get your results.

    `@mws.reports.get_report_request_list`

* GetReport - Used to request a report by report ID. All reports are currently returned as a flat file string.

    `@mws.reports.get_report :report_id => '11223344'`

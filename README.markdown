ruby-mws
========

Under development!
------------------

ruby-mws is a Ruby gem that wraps the Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS) API. Right now it only supports Amazon's Order and Inventory APIs. 

Please use at your own risk. This has not been tested thoroughly and is not guaranteed to work in any capacity. See the LICENSE file for more details.

Quick Start
-----------

### Initialize the connection object

Pass in your developer account credentials. All four params below are required.

    mws = MWS.new (:aws_access_key_id => "AKIAIFKEXAMPLE4WZHHA",
      :secret_access_key => "abc123def456/SECRET/+ghi789jkl",
      :seller_id => "A27WEXAMPLEBXY",
      :marketplace_id => "ATVPDKIKX0DER")

### Make a request

Let's use the Orders API to retrieve recently updated orders.

    # Retrieve all orders updated within the last 4 hours
    response = mws.orders.list_orders :last_updated_after => 4.hours.ago   # ActiveSupport time helper

(All datetime fields accept Time or DateTime objects, as well as strings in iso8601 format.)

### Parse the response

We can parse our response to view the orders and any other data returned.

    response.orders.first   # => { "amazon_order_id" => "002-EXAMPLE-0031387",
                                   "purchase_date" => "2012-01-13T19:11:46.000Z",
                                   ... }

Response objects are accessible in Hash or method notation.

    response.orders == response[:orders]   # => true

Use `keys` and `has_key?` to discover what's in the response.

    response.keys   # => ["last_updated_before", "orders"]
    response.has_key? :last_updated_before   # => true

### NextToken requests

For responses with long lists of data, results are returned from the service in pages (usually 100 per page). Example:

    response = mws.orders.list_orders :last_updated_after => 1.week.ago   # returns 100 orders

Here, there are more orders to be returned. You can call `has_next?` on the same API instance to see if the last response returned has a next page. If so, calling `next` will make the request for the next page.

    mws.orders.has_next?   # => true
    next_response = mws.orders.next   # returns next page of orders

You can keep calling `next` on the API instance as long as `has_next?` returns true.

You can always go about the manual way as per Amazon's docs:

    next_response = mws.orders.list_orders_by_next_token :next_token => response.next_token

### Underscore notation

ruby-mws wraps Amazon's CamelCase convention with Ruby-friendly underscore notation. This goes for request names and params, as well as response field names.

API
---

    @mws = MWS.new(authentication_hash)   # initialize the connection object

This object can be used to access all API services. Below are examples on how to make the different requests that are available so far. Refer to the [Amazon MWS Reference Docs](https://developer.amazonservices.com/) for available fields for each request.

### Orders API

* ListOrders - gets orders by time frame and other parameters

    `@mws.orders.list_orders :last_updated_after => Time.now-4.hours`

* GetOrder - gets orders by Amazon order ID

    `@mws.orders.get_order :amazon_order_id => "002-EXAMPLE-0031387"`

    `:amazon_order_id` can be an array to retrieve multiple orders.

* ListOrderItems - gets order items for one order ID

    `@mws.orders.list_order_items :amazon_order_id => "002-EXAMPLE-0031387"`

### Fulfillment Inventory API

* ListInventorySupply - returns availability of inventory, only returns items based on list of SKUs or last change date

    `@mws.inventory.list_inventory_supply :seller_skus => %w[PF-5VZN-04XR V4-03EY-LAL1 OC-TUKC-031P`
    `@mws.inventory.list_inventory_supply :query_start_date_time => Time.now-1.day`
